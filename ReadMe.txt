Tokenization Smart Contract
This project implements a tokenization system using Solidity, allowing for the creation and management of a custom ERC-20 token (ART) with features for auctions related payments. 
The contract is built using OpenZeppelin's ERC-20 implementation and is designed to handle token minting, price differences, and refunds in the context of an auction system.

Features
ERC-20 Token: Implements the standard ERC-20 token interface with additional functionality.

Auction System: Supports tokenization of assets with a minimum preset value and current price.

Escrow Payments: Manages payments between buyers and escrow accounts.

Refund Mechanism: Allows refunds of initial payments if the auction is unsuccessful.

Price Difference Collection: Collects additional tokens based on the difference between the current price and the minimum preset value.


Contract Overview
Key Variables
minimumPresetValue: The minimum value set for the auction.

currentPrice: The current price of the asset.

initialPayment: The initial payment made by the buyer.

buyerAddress: The address of the buyer.

escrowAddress: The address of the escrow account.

successful: A boolean indicating whether the auction was successful.


Key Functions
mint(address to, uint256 amount): Mints new tokens to the specified address.

collectDifference(): Collects additional tokens based on the price difference between currentPrice and minimumPresetValue.

releasetokens(): Releases the initial payment back to the buyer if the auction is unsuccessful.

Bidin(): Allow buyer to bid using blockchain

Highest(): Decide who won the auction

refund(): refund the deposit if failed

Why is it interesting?

1. Tokenization of Real-World Assets
What it does: The contract allows for the creation of tokens that represent real-world assets (e.g., art, real estate, or collectibles).

Why it's interesting: Tokenization enables fractional ownership, making high-value assets accessible to a broader audience. It also simplifies the transfer of ownership and reduces intermediaries.

2. Auction Mechanism with Escrow
What it does: The contract includes an auction system with a minimum preset value and an escrow mechanism to securely handle payments.

Why it's interesting: Auctions are a common way to determine the fair market value of assets. By automating this process on the blockchain, the system becomes more transparent, secure, and resistant to manipulation.

3. Price Difference Collection
What it does: The contract calculates and collects additional tokens based on the difference between the current price and the minimum preset value.

Why it's interesting: This feature ensures that sellers are fairly compensated if the asset's value increases during the auction, while buyers are incentivized to bid competitively.

4. Refund Mechanism
What it does: If the auction is unsuccessful, the contract automatically refunds the initial payment to the buyer.

Why it's interesting: This builds trust between buyers and sellers by ensuring that funds are securely held in escrow and only released under predefined conditions.

5. Decentralization and Transparency
What it does: The contract runs on a blockchain, ensuring that all transactions are immutable and publicly verifiable.

Why it's interesting: Decentralization eliminates the need for intermediaries, reducing costs and increasing trust. Transparency ensures that all parties can verify the fairness of the auction process.
